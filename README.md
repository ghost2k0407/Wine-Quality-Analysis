# **Wine Quality Analysis**

## **1. Understanding the Dataset**
The dataset consists of **red wine samples**, with various **chemical properties** used to predict **wine quality** (rated on a scale of 0–10). The key features include:

### **Physicochemical Properties (Independent Variables)**
- `fixed acidity`
- `volatile acidity`
- `citric acid`
- `residual sugar`
- `chlorides`
- `free sulfur dioxide`
- `total sulfur dioxide`
- `density`
- `pH`
- `sulphates`
- `alcohol`

### **Target Variable (Dependent Variable)**
- `quality` (Wine quality score, usually ranging from 3 to 8)

## **2. Data Preprocessing**
To prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling, the following steps are performed:

### **A. Handling Missing Data**
- Check for any missing or null values in the dataset.
- If any missing values are found, decide whether to **remove** or **impute** them.

### **B. Checking for Outliers**
- **Boxplots and IQR Method** are used to identify extreme values.
- Outliers in features like `volatile acidity` or `sulphates` can affect model performance.

### **C. Normalization & Scaling**
- Features like `alcohol`, `sulphates`, and `density` may have different scales.
- **Standardization (Z-score normalization)** or **MinMax Scaling** is used to bring them to a uniform scale.

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
### **A. Descriptive Statistics**
- Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand data distribution.

### **B. Correlation Analysis**
- **Heatmaps** and **pairplots** show relationships between variables.
- Example insights:
  - **Higher alcohol levels** may correlate with better wine quality.
  - **High volatile acidity** might negatively impact quality.

### **C. Visualizations**
- **Histograms**: Show distribution of individual features.
- **Boxplots**: Identify variations and potential outliers.
- **Scatter plots**: Show relationships between features like `alcohol` vs. `quality`.

---

## **4. Feature Selection & Engineering**
- Selecting the most important variables based on correlation and statistical tests.
- Removing highly correlated redundant features (if needed).
- Creating new derived features (e.g., `acidity ratio` = `fixed acidity` / `volatile acidity`).

## **5. Model Building & Evaluation**
Depending on the project goals, two main approaches can be used:

### **A. Classification Approach**
- Converts wine quality into **categories** (e.g., Low: 3-5, Medium: 6, High: 7-8).
- Models used:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Neural Networks**

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix for classification performance

### **B. Regression Approach**
- Predicts **exact quality score** instead of classifying into categories.
- Models used:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)**

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

---

## **6. Insights & Business Impact**
- **What factors contribute to high-quality wine?**
  - Alcohol, acidity levels, and sulphates tend to impact quality the most.
- **Can we predict wine quality reliably?**
  - If models perform well (>80% accuracy), this could help winemakers adjust production processes.
- **How can wineries use this data?**
  - Improve fermentation and chemical composition to produce high-quality wine.
